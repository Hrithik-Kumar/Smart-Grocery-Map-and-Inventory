# Smart Grocery Map and Inventory
## Motivation
- In large stores, people often lack a convenient way to find all their goods. Without guidance around the place, shoppers always have to traverse the entire store just to find a small item. Most stores like Walmart or IKEA don't have a detailed map labeling every item or section. With this information missing, it could waste a lot of people's time when they search for multiple items at once. 
- Our platform will help generate an optimal map based on a shopper's e-cart or grocery list that maps out the shortest path to get all their goods.
- Team boundarybreakers will contribute its skills to create a mobile application that addresses the issue mentioned above.
