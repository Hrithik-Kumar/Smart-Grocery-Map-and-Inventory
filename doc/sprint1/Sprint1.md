## Sprint 1 Planning Meeting: 

 - This meeting is held on 25th Sept,2021 by using Miscrosoft Teams. This meeting is to decide the estimate point per feature and allocate tasks to team members. In the meeting, we first discussed the estimate point for each feature. Then we separated tasks into subtasks and most tasks are separated by frontend and backend. Every team member gets their responsible tasks to work on.

## Team Capacity:
 - In our initial plan, one estimate point stands for half an hour to one hour smooth coding, which smooth here means work without bugs and confusion. We try to allocate tasks around 8 estimate points  for each of us. Considering we need time to get used to the new softwares and we are very likely to have bugs, the estimated time for each member is around 2 hours a day. In sprint1, we are going to do 52-points work.
